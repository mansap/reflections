Q.1. 
When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your 
work local?
If there is someone else working on the project or if I am working from some
other machine other than my own local machine

Q.2.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because the developer is the best person to decide when and what features 
need to be updated and taken from other collaborating developers

Q.3
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would 
you use one instead of another?
Forks: To take someone elses code as base and work/build upon it or
customize it for use
Clones: When you are collaborating with someone, you can clone the repo 
so that all colaborators can work on the same copy of the file
Branches: When you want to add a different feature/experiement with 
some new feature or simply have multiple versions of the same product

Q.4
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the 
remote stored locally?
We can make changes on the updated version and our peer collaborators, 
when they make changes, they would be working on the same copy. Thus, 
it would be easier to merge the code at a later stage together.
