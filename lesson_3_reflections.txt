Q.1. 
When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your 
work local?
If there is someone else working on the project or if I am working from some
other machine other than my own local machine

Q.2.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because the developer is the best person to decide when and what features 
need to be updated and taken from other collaborating developers
