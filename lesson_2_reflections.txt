How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is like a temporary container which holds files which are 
logically related and need to be committed togther in one commit. 
This helps in easier tracking of files which are logicall equivalent.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical 
change?
If we make any changes, the difference is immediately shown i staging area.
So, if we keep checking status of our files on a regular basis, we can make 
sure we commit per logical change.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?
If wewant to make some experimental changes in our code, then we can so so 
without changing any of our master/working code and go ahead and make a new
version oof it al-together. Later if required, we can merge the two together.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
Pictorial representation makes the concept extremely easy to understand 
and very clear.
